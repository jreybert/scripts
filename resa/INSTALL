=========

DateTime perl module
perl-suid

To install, use the install.pl script (you must be root). It does the following:
 - copy scripts in /usr/local/bin
 - create book-node user and group
 - chmod +s book-node script
 - create and set owner for /var/lib/book-node/ directory

book-node needs DateTime perl module to work:
 - you can find it here: http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky/DateTime/
 - if you have cpanm, you only need one line: % cpanm DateTime
 - alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:
    % cpan DateTime
 - or you can simply install with apt: apt-get install libdatetime-perl
